# High Speed Study: _burning time_
This is an exploration of light and movement.  The subject of this series is the object of money in the state of burning.  This is an allegory and commentary on our lives, the current social-political landscape and the emerging OnDemand culture. The series is roughly 30 mins loop.  A short 7 min clip is featured below.  The slow motion footage fights to retain the viewers attention and strives to make the viewer uncomfortable and uneasy.  

The films was captured using the Edgertronic High Speed Camera using various framerates between 300 to 1000 frames per second.  I wanted to explore the intrinsic characteristics of our IR filterless Edgertronic. The absence of an IR filter allowed for shooting in very low lighting conditions such as candle light.  The videos were edited and color corrected in Adobe Premiere Pro.
