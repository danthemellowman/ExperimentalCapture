# High Speed Study: Burning Time
This is an exploration of light and movement.  The subject of this series is the object of money in the state of burning.  This is an allegory and commentary on our lives, the current social-political landscape and the emerging OnDemand culture.

The films was captured using the Edgertronic High Speed Camera using various framerates between 300 to 1000 frames per second.  I wanted to explore the intrinsic characteristics of our IR filterless Edgertronic and shooting in candle light conditions where the subject is only source of light.  The videos were edited and color corrected in Adobe Premiere Pro.
