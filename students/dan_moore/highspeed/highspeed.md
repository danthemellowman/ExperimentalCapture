# High Speed Study: _burning time_
This is an exploration of light and movement.  The subject of this series is the act of burning money.  This is an allegory and commentary on our lives, the current social-political landscape and the emerging OnDemand culture. The full series is a 30 mins loop.  A short 7 min clip is featured below.  The slow motion footage fights to retain the viewers attention and strives to make the viewer feel uncomfortable and uneasy. The viewer's experience is meant to be a painfully slow interjected with moments of satisfaction.

The series was shot using the Edgertronic High Speed Camera.  The series was captured a various speeds ranging between 300 to 1000 frames per second.  I wanted to explore the intrinsic characteristics of the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry's IR filter-less Edgertronic. The absence of an IR filter allows for shooting in very low lighting conditions such as candle light.  The videos were edited and color corrected in Adobe Premiere Pro.
